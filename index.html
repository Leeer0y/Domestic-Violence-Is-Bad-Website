                            Coercive control is a type of abuse where a partner ensures that you stay with them. Those who suffer from coercive control may
                            experience the following:

                        <h1>Physical Abuse</h1>
                        <p>Physical abuse is when a family member or partner physically abuses you,
                            forcing you into something that you are not comfortable doing. Perhaps they are being violent because they perceived that you did
                            something
                            "wrong", or maybe they had a bad day and they are taking it out on you, or maybe they
                            are drunk or high.</p>

                        <h1>Emotional Abuse</h1>
                        <p>Emotional abuse is a form of psychological abuse where someone (often a family member or partner) plays with
                            your emotions to get their own
                            way, otherwise known as "manipulation". Another form of emotional abuse is exposure to any behavior that may result in psychological trauma (including anxiety,
                            chronic depression,
                            or post-traumatic stress disorder). Such exposure may include violence.</p>

                            Don't let them take control of you. If they try to manipulate you or force you into doing something you're not comfortable with, say that you don't want to and that you feel uncomfortable. Sometimes people don't realise they are being abusive and you need to let them know. If they don't listen or change get help immediately - call a helpline and get support from people you trust (i.e. a parent, a teacher, etc.). 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are being abused by a partner, end the relationship. If your partner attempts to blackmail you, ignore it or it's not going to stop, call a helpline or contact the local police.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are getting abused by a family member, see a school counsellor, talk to a teacher, or make contact with someone you trust. The worst thing you can do when getting abused is to stay silent about it.

                            This website was created to help and inform people about domestic violence and its statistics.
                            This initiative was selected because I know people who have suffered or are suffering from domestic violence, and I want to 
                            spread awareness of what people have gone through and how to stop it.
